All of my projects are simple(ish) web-interfaces for manipulating some kind of interesting visualization.

They all suffer from ui-designed-by-engineer(&trade;). You'll see what I mean.

## Bezier Curves

A web interface for manipulating [Bezier Curves [🡕]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).

## LSystems
A web interface for manipulating [LSystems [🡕]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

## More LSystems
A older Lsystem interface. It's not my favorite but it has a few interesting features:

* Depth Control
* Fancier Animation Playback

Ultimately both of these things are unnecessary - the newer version is simpler while still providing most of the same functionality.
