## Introduction

Better people than I have worked to defined and explain L-Systems, so please browse some of the following links for an indepth explanation:
* [How to create L-Systems – Houdini Kitchen](https://www.houdinikitchen.net/2019/12/21/how-to-create-l-systems/)
* [L-Systems - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

## Version 2
A newer version that includes forward animation and adjustable animation controls. 

The basic controls are too "Load" a curve with the button at the top left then render it with the button at the bottom middle.

Here are some interesting visualizations you can use by referring to the "Houdini's Kitchen" above

## Version 1

A older Lsystem interface. It’s not my favorite but it has a few interesting features:

* Depth Control
* Fancier Animation Playback

Ultimately both of these things are unnecessary - the newer version is simpler while still providing most of the same functionality.
