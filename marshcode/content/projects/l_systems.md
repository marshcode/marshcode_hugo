# Version 2
A web interface for manipulating [LSystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

# Version 1

A older Lsystem interface. Itâ€™s not my favorite but it has a few interesting features:

* Depth Control
* Fancier Animation Playback
* 
Ultimately both of these things are unnecessary - the newer version is simpler while still providing most of the same functionality.
