# Version 2
A web interface for manipulating [LSystems [🡕]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

# Version 1

A older Lsystem interface. It’s not my favorite but it has a few interesting features:

Depth Control
Fancier Animation Playback
Ultimately both of these things are unnecessary - the newer version is simpler while still providing most of the same functionality.
